# Tarn Aeluin Mobile

This app will be a viewing app for my Wordpress blog at https://tarnaeluin.houseofbeor.net. The app
should work with any Wordpress blog that has the REST API interface enabled. Currently this app will
only support reading data and not writing.

Sounds boring, right? Well this is just a way for me to play around with the Wordpress API and how
to get content flowing into an app in a nice way.

## Getting Started

This is a pretty straight forward build. Clone the code and do a pub get. You'll need to configure
an .env file with the parameter TARN_AELUIN_BASE_URL that should be set to the base url of a Wordpress blog
that you would like to intergrate with.
